A collection of miscelaneous utilities to generate ICMP pings, with a focus on
network monitoring and security.

pingdev: A (Linux) CUSE-based device driver for /dev/ping, which can be used to
monitor a single host from unprivledged userspace.  More features are planned
for the future, at least bringing functionality up to match pingerd.

pingerd: A daemon that serves requests sent on a local socket to ping remote
hosts and return results.  Allows unprivledged processes to ping hosts subject
to various constraints (packet limits, allowed networks, etc.).

pinger: An example client for pingerd.

pingmon: A liboping-based ping monitor that can regularly ping an number of
host and write complete but concise logs to a file at only 4 bytes per ping + 4
bytes per host.  Should be converted to use one of the above.

pingstat: A haskell program to analyze pingmon output.  Not nearly as efficient
or useful as it should be.
